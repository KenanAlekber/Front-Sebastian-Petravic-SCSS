                        <h3>My Career So Far</h3>

                        <span>Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups and was a member of the first
                            New Zealand start-up to attend Y Combinator, the largest start-up accelerator in the world.
                            From there, I worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the
                            design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. Currently I am a Senior Product Designer at Linktree
                            leading design for the Linktree mobile app</span>

                        bold
                        designs. He is a natural problem solver in the design space so everyone went to him if they were
                        stuck on a feature or flow. He has a arsenal of design skills including animation and graphic
                        design. Not to mention, Seb was a design team lead, which means he managed a full team of both
                        onshore and offshore designs reviewing and providing feedback on all of their designs... Any
                        business would be lucky to have him."</span>
